# SoSoReads
*Another Node Goodreads wrapper*

Apparently when Amazon acquired Goodreads they decided to ship the half-built API and never finish it. Thanks, Amazon.

So there are lots of wrappers: 
- [Goodreads](https://github.com/sosedoff/goodreads) (Ruby) looks like the most popular.
- [BetterReads](https://github.com/thejessleigh/betterreads) (Python) was my first name idea and looks great. It was built on goodreads2, another Python wrapper.
- I haven't looked at them in-depth yet, but there are a bunch of Node versions: [fff-graphql-goodreads](https://github.com/mpj/fff-graphql-goodreads), [goodreads-api-node](https://github.com/baahrens/goodreads-api-node), [goodreads.js](https://github.com/AnalogJ/goodreads.js), [goodreads-json](https://github.com/rosnovsky/goodreads-json), [goodreads-json-api](https://github.com/myke11j/goodreads-json-api), [Goodreads review JSON export](https://github.com/remy/goodreads), and [node-goodreads](https://github.com/bdickason/node-goodreads). They are mostly incomplete and I want a cleaner interface.
